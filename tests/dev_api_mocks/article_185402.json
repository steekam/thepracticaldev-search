In this industry, learning new concepts and languages/frameworks is<br>\nmandatory to keep up with the rapid changes. Take for example React - open-sourced by Facebook just a shy 4 years ago it already became the number one choice for JavaScript devs around the globe. But also Vue and Angular, of course, have their legitimate follower-base. And then there is Svelte, and universal frameworks like Next.js or Nuxt.js, and Gatsby, and Gridsome, and Quasar, and and and. If you want to shine as an expert JavaScript developer you should at least have some experience in different frameworks and libraries - besides doing your homework with good, old JS.</p>\n\n<p>To help you become Frontend Masters, I have collected 9 different projects, each with a distinct topic and a different JavaScript framework or library as a tech stack that you can build and add to your portfolio. Remember, nothing helps you more than actually building stuff so go ahead, sharpen your mind and make this happen!</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"build-a-movie-search-app-using-react-with-hooks\" href=\"#build-a-movie-search-app-using-react-with-hooks\" class=\"anchor\">\n  </a>\n  Build a movie search app using React (with hooks)\n</h2>\n\n<p>The first thing you could start with is building a movie search app using React.

Okay, To-Do apps are not necessarily the hottest topic out there but this will really help you to sharpen you Svelte skills and look like this:<br>\n<a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4RqH3NUX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/0%2A5R-0APqCDcUuQN5e.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4RqH3NUX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/0%2A5R-0APqCDcUuQN5e.png\" alt=\"Example project Svelte\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"what-you-will-learn\" href=\"#what-you-will-learn\" class=\"anchor\">\n  </a>\n  What you will learn\n</h3>\n\n<p>This tutorial will show you how to make an app using Svelte 3 from start to finish.
